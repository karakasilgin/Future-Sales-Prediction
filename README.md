# Future-Sales-Prediction
The TV, Radio, Newspaper, and Sales Prediction repository is a Python-based project that explores the relationship between advertising spending and sales for a hypothetical company. The repository includes a dataset with information on advertising spending for TV, radio, and newspaper ads, as well as sales figures for the company.

Using Python, we have performed exploratory data analysis on the dataset, examining the relationships between the various advertising channels and sales. We have also created several predictive models to estimate the impact of advertising spending on sales, including linear regression, decision trees, and random forests.

In addition to the code and data, this repository includes documentation on the project and the various techniques used. It is intended to serve as a resource for anyone interested in learning more about predictive modeling and data analysis with Python.

Whether you are a data scientist, business owner, or just someone interested in exploring the relationship between advertising spending and sales, this repository is an excellent resource for gaining insights and building predictive models using Python.
